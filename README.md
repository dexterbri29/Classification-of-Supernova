# Classification-of-Supernova

Supernovae, or the death and collapse of stars, can be classified into four different types. 
For supernovae spectra with the absence of hydrogen, but show a presence of silicon are Type Ia, which are the results of the explosion of a white-dwarf made of carbon and oxygen in a binary system.
Spectra showing an absence of hydrogen and silicon, but have the presence of helium fall into the category of Type Ib. The absence of all three elements are Type Ic. Supernova in which hydrogen is present are classified as Type II. Each of these three types occur due to a collapse of the core of massive stars. 

Based on these parameters, this project is focused on catagorizing and classifying recent supernova (between the years 2015-2019).
